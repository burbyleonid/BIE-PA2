  <h1>Tower Defense Game Documentation</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>In this semestral project, I decided to work on a Tower-defense game. It is a step-by-step game with multiple difficulty levels and the ability to choose the desired level to play.</p>
  <h2>Game Concept</h2>
  <p>The game starts with the player having a certain amount of resources, such as gold, steel, and wood. The player can use the interface to build different types of towers, each with its own attributes, mainly damage and attack distance.</p>
  <h3>Game Flow</h3>
  <p>Once the game is started, the player can begin building towers. After completing the tower construction, enemies will start to attack the main building. By successfully defeating different types of enemies, the player will earn additional resources to build new towers.</p>
  <h3>Gameplay Mechanism</h3>
  <p>The gameplay involves selecting a tower by clicking on it, and then clicking on enemies to specify the target for the tower's attack. This action will be repeated in each step until the game ends.</p>
  <h2>Game Save/Load</h2>
  <p>The game provides the functionality to save and load game progress using a custom file format with the extension ".game". The player can choose any preferred name for the saved game file.</p>
  <h2>Graphics and GUI</h2>
  <p>The game's graphical user interface (GUI) will be created using the SDL2 library. The graphics, including textures, will consist of open-source pixel art images.</p>
