In this semestral project, I decided to work on a Tower-defense game. I think that it is going to be a simple step-by-step
game with a few difficulty levels with the option to choose which one you would like to play. Initially player will have
some amount of resources like gold, steel, and wood. Using the interface player is able to build different types of towers
with different attributes (mainly damage and attack distance will change). I assume that once the game is started player 
could build towers and once he is done with that, the enemies will try to attack the main building. By killing the different
types of enemies, the player will be rewarded with different resources so he could add new towers. I think this function will
be implemented by clicking on the tower to choose it and then clicking on enemies to specify which tower will attack the target.
And this action will be repeated each step until the game ends. Also, it will be possible to load and store the game using a custom
format .game with any preferred name. GUI will be created using the SDL2 library and graphics (texture) will be open-source pixel art images.
