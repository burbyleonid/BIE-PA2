1) Class Field - main class for creating the map. Contains a type to understand what we have in that field like
a main building, different types of towers, or just an empty field.

2) Class Game - describes the basic functions of starting and keeping
the game, as well as the gameplay. Allows you to create a game, build a building, start a new day, load,
and save the game.

3) Classes Defines - a class that describes the base dimensions when creating all windows.

4) Class MainWindow - the main window that starts when the game starts. Allows you to start a new game, 
save and load the game. Has a relationship with the class Game.

5) Class UIBase - the main class for working with graphics.

6) Class UIButton - a class that allows you to work with buttons, is inherited from the class UIBase.

7) Class UILoadDialog - the class that handles the loading of the game.

8) Class UISaveDialog - the class that handles the saving of the game.

9) Class UIText - allows you to work with text, display it on the screen, and support a font called Coffee_Extra. 
Inherited from class UIBase.

10) Class UITextures - allows working with textures, loading from a file, and displaying on the screen


Those classes are not implemented yet but should be in the final version:

11) Class Levels - a class that will contain a description of the map, based on the Field class with a path of enemies
and possible places for towers.

12) Enemies - main class for all Enemies. A few more specific classes will be inhered from it, with different attributes.

The main usage of polymorphism will be while working with graphs and GUI.
